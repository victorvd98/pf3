            <p>Hi I'm Victor! I'm a design-minded advertising creative with big balls, and even bigger ideas.</p>
            <p>I grew up in many places including Accra and Shanghai. But these days I'm based in Brussels, where I do creative things (whatever that means).</p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy eating spicy food, listening to Ariana Grande, and tinkering with questionable <a href="https://github.com/victorvd98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="github">coding projects</a>.</p>
            <p>Thanks for dropping by and feel free to say hello via <a href="mailto:victor.van.damme@icloud.com" id="email">email</a>!</p>
