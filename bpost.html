<strong>Turning fans into superfans — one locker at a time.</strong> <br>
<p>To promote Bpost’s parcel lockers, we gave fans a new way to connect with the Red Devils: by sending real mail straight to the team’s training ground. A campaign that blended tech, emotion, and national pride — delivered, quite literally, locker to locker.</p>
<p>Fans could drop off messages, gifts, and good-luck charms at any Bpost parcel locker in Belgium. We placed one special locker at the Red Devils’ training camp in Tubize — and let the players do the unboxing. The surprise, joy, and gratitude were all captured and shared on social.</p>
